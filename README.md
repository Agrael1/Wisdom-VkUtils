# Wisdom utility header generator for Vulkan

Serves as a header generator for the Vulkan API. It is based on the vk.xml file from the KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers repository.


# Contents [TODO]

- A header only vulkan loader implementation (vulkan_loader.h)
- Managed handle implementation (vulkan_managed.h) 

# Intended use

The generator is used to generate up-to-date headers for Wisdom project. However, it can be used for other projects as well. 
The generated output is specifically constrained to the needs of Wisdom project, but it can be easily modified.
